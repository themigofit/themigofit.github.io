<p><strong>Nutrascia Fast-D Carb</strong>is a delicious post-workout supplement designed to help replenish muscle glycogen stores and shuttle critical nutrients into your muscles fast to help optimize muscle recovery, growth and strength.</p>
<p><strong>FASTER GLYCOGEN REPLENISHMENT</strong>&#8211; Research suggests that consuming high-glycemic carbs immediately after training is the best way to replenish muscle glycogen stores.</p>
<p><strong>ENHANCED NUTRIENT TRANSPORT</strong>&#8211; Dextrose is the fastest absorbing carb which is ideal for raising insulin in your bloodstream immediately after workouts to help shuttle glucose, amino-acids, and creatine to hard-working muscle cells.</p>
<p><strong>GREAT TASTE</strong>– Post-workout is the one time when having a sugary drink will actually benefit your body.  Simply mix with water enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>REPLENISH WITH FAST CARBS</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nutrascia Fast-D Carb</strong>is pure dextrose, which is the equivalent of glucose – the fastest-absorbing form of simple carbohydrates there is. Intense training depletes your muscles of glycogen (the storage form of carbohydrates), and this glycogen needs to be replenished to ensure adequate recovery for greater endurance, maximal strength and muscle-building gains.</p>
<p><strong><u>REFUEL AFTER TRAINING</u></strong></p>
<p>One scoop of <strong>Nutrascia Fast-D Carb</strong> provides 50 grams of carbohydrates from dextrose – an effective amount to help maximize recovery by replenishing glycogen stores after an intense workout.</p>
<p><strong><u>FULL GLYOCGEN STORES EQUALS BETTER RECOVERY</u></strong></p>
<p>When <strong>Nutrascia Fast-D Carb</strong> is consumed immediately post-workout, a “supercompensation” of muscle glycogen stores is possible. More importantly, delaying carb consumption by just 2 hours may reduce the rate of glycogen replenishment by up to 50%.</p>
<p><strong><u>ENHANCED NUTRIENT ABSORPTION</u></strong></p>
<p>Another benefit of high-glycemic carbs like dextrose is the insulin spike they deliver. A post-workout increase in insulin may help promote the uptake of creatine, beta-alanine, and carnitine by the muscle cells.</p>

<p><strong>GAIN MUSCLE MINUS THE FAT WITH Nutrascia pro MASS</strong></p>
<p>Pro Mass is the first comprehensive mass gainer designed to help you increase muscle mass without gaining fat. Unlike other mass gainers that provide you with four times the amount of carbs compared to protein and exceed 1000 calories per serving—leading to fat gain—you’ll end up spending more effort and money to shed that unwanted fat, <strong>Pro Mass</strong> contains a 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein for “clean” gains. <strong>Pro Mass</strong> is also enhanced with scientifically proven digestive enzymes that will benefit you in using every gram of your formula in building your muscles. Along side with the multivitamin complex that will help in the metabolism of your formula &amp; enhancing your immunity. Beside a group of essential minerals for your vitality &amp; immunity. The amino acids complex is vital in gaining muscles mass, neglecting it in your mass gainer is a fatal mistake, Nutrascia would never commit such a mistake, Pro mass is fuelled with the most essential &amp; valuable amino acids for you.</p>
<p><strong>Whether you use it as a meal supplement on the go or as a mass gainer, rest assured that you’re getting quality ingredients and quality calories that, when combined with training and a proper whole food diet, will go toward packing on lean muscle mass, not excess body fat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Pro Mass Is Different Than Other Mass Gainers</strong></p>
<p>It’s not enough to know just the total amount of protein, carbs and fat that a mass-gainer provides – you need to know the precise amounts of each type of protein, each type of carb, and each type of fat. Otherwise, you won’t know if it’s a lean-mass-builder or just another “fat-gainer” made of cheap protein concentrate and sugar. Pro Mass is essentially designed to give you the perfect ratios of Protein Blend to carbs – primarily low-glycemic and the perfect fat blend.</p>
<p>Each serving of <strong>Pro Mass</strong> contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>50 grams of Multi-Stage Absorption Protein Mix:</strong> 20 grams of fast-absorbing whey, 20 grams of slow-absorbing casein, and 10 grams of medium-absorbing egg protein.</li>
<li><strong>100 grams of Multi-Stage Absorption Carb Mix:</strong> 40 grams of fast-absorbing carbs, 40 grams of slow-absorbing carbs, and 20 grams of fiber (sourced from wheat germ, oats, potato starch, dextrose, and maltodextrin).</li>
<li><strong>10 grams of Healthy Fats:</strong> 3 grams of saturated fats, 3 grams of monounsaturated fats, 3 grams of polyunsaturated fats, and 1 gram of CLA.</li>
<li><strong>Amino Acid Mix:</strong> 3 grams of creatine, 10 grams of BCAAs, and 8 grams of glutamine (from both added and naturally occurring sources).</li>
<li><strong>Omega 3 and 6.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive set of vitamins and minerals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>A blend of digestive enzymes.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll find more details and the benefits of each group in the ingredients list.</p>
